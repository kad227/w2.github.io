    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      We sought to quantify the difference in pointing performance between a subject's right and left hand, and if this was affected by the subject's handedness.  We completed trials using the trackpad of a MacBook Pro.  We conducted a test using the GoFitts application.  We conducted 9 trials at 9 levels of difficulty, using amplitudes of 100, 200, 400 and widths of 20, 40, 80.  The combinations of amplitude and width were randomized.  Two of the subjects were right-handed and preferred to use the trackpad with their right hand.  The other two subjects were left-handed but still preferred to use the trackpad with their right hand.  We sought to investigate if the subject's preferred trackpad hand performed better than their non-preferred hand, or if it was instead better with their dominant hand.  Our hypothesis was that all subjects would perform better with their preferred hand due to training and expertise rather than performing better with their dominant hand regardless of training.  As the data below indicates, at all levels of difficulty our subjects did indeed produce a higher throughput with their preferred hand regardless of their natural dominance.  In general performance with a preferred hand is approximately 1 bit/sec higher across all levels of difficulty tested, which confirms our hypothesis.
